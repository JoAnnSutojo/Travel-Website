                <p>Some say Lombok reminds them of Bali decades ago, before the island became a tourist magnet. The landscape and beaches here are no doubt on par with Bali – in fact, their pristine state may make them even more beautiful. Among the most glorious sights are the volcano Mount Rinjani and Pink Beach. The Gili Islands, just off the coast of Lombok, are also a must-visit, offering a mix of natural beauty and modern attractions such as luxury resorts and hip bars. <a href="" class="clickMore">Click for more</a></p>
